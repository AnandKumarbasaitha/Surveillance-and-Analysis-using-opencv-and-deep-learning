# Surveillance-and-Analysis-using-Image-Processing
An Application which detects if the person is wearing mask or not to avoid the spread of COVID 19 and tracks the movement of the person coming inside a building using pretained caffemodel and dlib tracker. The model for detecting mask is trained on a dataset taken from Kaggle,RMFD,Google Search. It tracks the count and different features of the person and gives analysis to the organisation in a given period of time.

Running the project
1) Setup the enviroment with libraries given in requirements.txt
2) Open the track.py file and change the path of models and videos.
3) Run the track.py file
